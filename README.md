## Summary

This was my second application I made. I learned some really good things about JavaScript while making this application, specifically addEventListeners and making functional buttons.

One of the first struggles I had was not taking the easy way out by writing codes I had seen in tutorials and really diving deeper into JavaScript to really understand what I was writing.
